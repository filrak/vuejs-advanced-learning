# Advanced and in-depth learning resources for Vue.js
While it's quite easy to find tutorials about Vue.js things are getting much harder when you want to learn something beyond the basics 
I hope that this list will make it much easier for everyone to learn advanced and non-trivial Vue stuff about architecture, patterns, it's internals and real-world use cases. 

**All of the listed resources are dedicated for developers who are already familiar with Vue.js and have some prior experience with this framework.**

If you know some courses/articles about advanced Vue patterns, in-depth explainations or just non-trivial stuff that would be helpful for other vue developers please don't hesitate to share them!
